Never Again!
============

Never Again! is a little web app that's meant to take some of the load off the data and tech teams of [The Texas Tribune](http://www.texastribune.org) and provide some basic capabilities to reporters. The hope is to make it easy for reporters to add basic forms of interactivity to their stories. The easier it is == the more likely it will happen.

Caveats
-------

Currently, Never Again! is built to suit The Texas Tribune way of doing things. I plan to "de-Tribune" it in the near future so it's more generic. That way others can pull it in and add their own customizations on top of the basic framework.

Installation
------------

Pretty easy. Clone the repository, then:

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

If you are running it locally, you can just use `python app.py`. It's also ready to go to be pushed up to a [Heroku](http://www.heroku.com) instance. [Check out a demo here](http://never-again.herokuapp.com).
